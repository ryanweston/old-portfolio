# Portfolio

🛠 This portfolio project is still currently a **work in progress**.

Current progress: <http://ryanweston.me>

An stylistically updated and more minimal approach to my previous development and design portfolio. I decided to do this to further explore my curiosity with 3D web technologies and to continue to improve my skills following finishing my second academic year at university.

## Technologies

- ThreeJS
    - Draco
    - GLTF Pipeline
- NodeJS 
    - Express
    

 
## Roadmap

- 🏠 Shift the front-end into React.
- 🔐 After moving to React, explore serverless options.
- 🚗 Move from local ThreeJS library files (depracated at the end of 2020), to modules.
- 🏃‍ Learn and incorporate the use  of ThreeJS animations, making use of materials & post-processing with JS events.
- 📝 Add a static blog.
- ⏳ Begin developing an open source "developer/maker progress" concept and include within the site.
